This is **Unofficial Ruffle Flash Player** Based on [Ruffle Flash Emulator](https://ruffle.rs).

I'm not the official developer of Ruffle. For issues and documentation related to the emulator, please refer to the official Ruffle repository documentation below.

# Flare for Mobile (POC)

> Flutter + Ruffle Self-hosted package wrapped in Flutter Webview

## ðŸ“¢ Compatibility

This app plots the emulator (built for self-hosted use) in a webview, so there may be a performance difference compared to the official Ruffle Desktop Application.

There is no built-in automatic update in the app. It is recommended to download the updated emulator version by referring to the GitHub Release page on a monthly basis.

## ðŸ”¨ Build & Run

This project is written in Dart + Flutter. For Flutter environment settings, please refer to the following documentation.

https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

```shell
$ flutter pub get
```

Once everything is ready, proceed with the steps below. If you do not proceed, the execution may not work correctly.

The project sources do not include the `Ruffle` source files. So, before building or testing, you need to get the latest version of Ruffle self-hosted distribution.

Download the latest version of the self-hosted version from the Ruffle Release Page, unzip it and paste it in the following path: `/assets/www/js/ruffle`

You only need to paste the `.map`, `.js`, `.wasm` files inside the compressed file.

The webview code is located in `assets/www`. We recommend applying the `eslint` and `prettier` settings to work with files located here.
